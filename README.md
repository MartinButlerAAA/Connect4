# Connect4

As each player in effect is chosing from columns 1 to 7, Connect 4 seemed a good exercise to try a Neural Net.

After reading Wikipedia about Neural Netorks - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)
I had a go at developing a Connect 4 game using a Neural Network.

The code is written in Java in one file containing one class.
The code can be built with Build.com.
The jar file should run, but if this doesn't work it can be called from Connect4.bat.
There are further details in Connect4.pdf

I have also run the jar file on my Android phone.
